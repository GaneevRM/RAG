            "Основная задача F.02 заключалась в подъёме листовых деталей из контейнеров и установке их на сварочные фиксаторы с допуском в 5 мм. После установки традиционные роботизированные манипуляторы выполняли сварку. Роботы загружали металл с циклом в 84 секунды, из которых 37 секунд приходились на саму загрузку. Точность оставалась выше 99%.\n",

            "Также стартап рассказал о проблемах с оборудованием, возникших во время внедрения F.02. Предплечье робота стало основной причиной отказа из-за сложности размещения трёх степеней свободы, системы охлаждения и прокладки кабелей в конечности человеческого размера. Постоянное движение создавало нагрузку на микроконтроллеры и проводку, что редко упоминается в сфере гуманоидных роботов.\n",

В тот момент на производстве были заняты около 11 тыс. человек. К ноябрю прошлого года Figure AI [обновила](https://habr.com/ru/news/859970/) F.02, чтобы роботы стали быстрее и лучше справлялись с задачами на производстве.\n",
